# Reconstruction of Hyperspectral Images from RGB images using depth separable 3D Convolution
This is an initiative funded by the IRD unit IIT Delhi under the Summer Undergrad Research Award. We intent to produce and efficient and reliable reconstruction technique for HSI (**Hyperspectral Images**).
## Initial Start 

* Initial run will be to
  * Download the BGU dataset / alternatively the Harvard dataset
  * Make the code more general for any fork
  * Be able to run it on 2D dep-sep before anything else :) 

## How to run the code?
